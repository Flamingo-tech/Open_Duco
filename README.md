# Open_Duco
Opensource firmware and hardware for Duco  Ventilation Boxes

Since I'm not happy with the functionallity of the Duco DucoBox Silent 400 m3/h I'm making an opensource version. (The general Quallity of these duco boxes is verry high and I would advice them to everyone) But for a tech savy nerd not tech enough.

Goals of the project:
 - Measure Humidity on every air duct.
 - Measure Co2 on every air duct.
 - Measure Temperature on every air duct.
 - Wifi enabled by default
 - Fully controllable by Home assistant
 - If themperature outside < inside use the Duco System to cool the inside of my house.

|----------------|-------------------------------|-----------------------------|-----------------------------|
|Mainboard|No         |-          |
|Moisture Sensor        |Yes            |V2.0        | 0000-4218
|Co2 Sensor         |No|-|
|Valve         |No|-|


This project is not supported by Duco the company nor is there any affiliation to the company. Using These sensor will probably void duco's warranty.
