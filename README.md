# Open_Duco
Opensource firmware and hardware for Duco  Ventilation Boxes

Since I'm not happy with the functionallity of the Duco DucoBox Silent 400 m3/h I'm making an opensource version. (The general Quallity of these duco boxes is verry high and I would recommend them to everyone) But for a tech savy nerd not tech enough.

Goals of the project:
 - Measure Humidity in every air duct.
 - Measure Co2 in every air duct.
 - Measure Temperature in every air duct.
 - Wifi enabled by default
 - Fully controllable by Home assistant
 - If themperature outside < inside use the Duco System to cool the inside of my house.
 - Support 8 Sensors

# Backwards Compatibility
If this is the awnser to this is yes, you can use the sensor in the original Duco Silent ventilation box.

# Important:
This project is not supported by Duco the company nor is there any affiliation to the company. Using these sensors will probably void duco's warranty.
